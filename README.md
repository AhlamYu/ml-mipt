## Prerequisites

We are expecting our students to have a basic knowlege of:

- calculus, especially matrix calculus, differentiation
- linear algebra
- probability theory and statistics
- programming, especially on Python

Although if you don't have any of this, you could substitude it with your
diligence because the course provides additional materials to study requirements
yourself.
